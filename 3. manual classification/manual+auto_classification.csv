We did a 3 days 2 nights staycation. We thought the standard had dropped drastically.
1. Zero wet weather planning
- the covered walkway from the carpark was terminated at the side entrance because of COVID-19 and throughout the stay the heavy rain never fail to get us drenched even with the umbrella. The narrow pathway to the main entrance is always competed by cyclists, joggers despite sign to deter usage. This makes commute very dangerous.
2. Covid food safety 1
- in one of our breakfast at Clifford Pier, we realised that one of the bottled jams was opened and used. It was left there for us. We alerted the staff about it.
3. Covid food safety 2
- the napkin covering the utensils in the same breakfast was wet and I it didn’t make me feel safe about the cleanliness.
4. Unattended walkie talkie 
- cleaning staff left their cleaning stations outside the narrow room corridor and had walkie talkie turned on while on duties.

Ok.

The hotel reminded me of a four star Las Vegas Hotel. Planet Hollywood comes to mind! 
I really have No complaints and I’m willing to come back and stay there on my next trip. 
As a side Note:
Be aware that some of the Front desk staff are a little hesitant to take Debit cards, And will ask you for a Deposit that the Hotel will return on check out.","•The Staff is very Attentive.

We chose the wellness suite, not for the wellness stuff, but for the nice location on the second floor, facing the beautiful historic street. Also for the large balcony. Unfortunately it was far too hot to sit outside, but the suite is so spacious that we didn’t miss it. Nicely furbished, very good bed and marvelous bathroom with toilet, bath, walk in shower and two bathroom sinks.The kitchenette comes with kettle, coffee machine, induction cooktop, microwave, small fridge and very few kitchenware. There was a saucepan and a frying pan, plates, cups, bowls and cutlery for two. No need to cook however, there are several restaurants in the hotel and the Maxwell Hawker center is just a few steps away. The minibar is free with soft drinks, sparkling and still water. There is a choice of coffee and teas. Nice and silent airco in the sleeping area and the living room. The bathroom has no airco, but we didn’t miss it. Breakfast is ok. There is no abundance, but the food is of good quality and there is everything one needs to start the day: good coffee, bread, eggs, sausage, brie, jam, muffins etc.We were warned there would be some noise from the street at night. It’s a lively street with restaurants, bars and terraces, so that’s normal. The noise is bearable during week days. Friday night was quite intense, with loud music, but at exactly 1:30 am the music stopped. Ann Siang house is a great place to stay. The staff is very friendly. We might come again another year.","The suite was very clean, however the carpet showed a lot of big stains. Depending from the moment of the day, we had very poor internet or no internet at all.

Aircon was old and it was a vent type not an actual airconditioning unit hence room is can get really hot and dusty. We had to sleep right under it.
Housekeeping changed sheets however floor and bathroom was not wiped down with cleaning sanitizer.
We had 4 people in the room - 2 adults & 2 kids, had to keep ringing reception for more towels.

"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering, Singapore - SG Clean, Staycation Approved","1.28580207,103.84636492",“Refreshing Eco-Friendly Staycation”,"Located about 20 minutes drive away from the Changi international airport in Singapore, the PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering is a 5-star, eco-friendly hotel. Known for its award-winning 'hotel-in-a-garden' design which incorporates elevated terraced gardens, green walls, water features, solar cells, and rainwater harvesting, PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering offers a rejuvenating escape in the midst of the city.Ambience at PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering is the highlight of any stay here. Surrounded by lush greenery despite the urban setting, the hotel is an oasis of escape. With high ceilings and water features around, the place exudes a calm tranquility, setting the mind at ease. Wood decor and energy efficient features complete the sustainable experience. The facade looks sleek yet welcoming, with ample greenery and water ponds flanking the walkway. Temperature taking is performed only at the main entry, so other entrances are currently closed.Rooms at PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering are large and relaxing. I stayed at the COLLECTION Lifestyle Room, which has a comfortable king bed and sofa. The working desk is decently sized, complete with an ergonomic Herman Miller sayl chair. The floor-to-ceiling windows allow ample natural light, but there are no views because of the ample landscaping outside. The bathroom is stocked with amenities, and there's a choice of multi-function shower or bathtub. The high-speed internet wifi is stable, but the cable television has limited channels.","Service at PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering is inconsistent, with the lower numbers of staff sometimes struggling to keep pace with the demand. Bags took 1.5 hours to arrive at the room after check-in, and there was disorganised confusion in which bag to be delivered to which room. On a particular afternoon, staff seated us in the lounge, but forgot to offer anything, leaving us sitting there without any menu, drinks, or tidbits. There was poor service recovery when a guest was unable to get a room on a high floor despite the request. All that said, staff were generally friendly and polite, and tried their best to manage difficult situations.",2020-11-26T00:00:00,Singapore,14,Ivan,6.0,"Leisure trip,Group,COLLECTION Lifestyle Room,Stayed 2 nights",1.0,1.0,1

The best part was truly the you g lady who basically ran the place. She was very nice and helpful. Laundry was inexpensive and quick.,"The BED IS THE WORST.  Seriously ROCK hard. Very very uncomfortable. The day we checked out they brought in new mattress toppers. Gosh I don’t know if they will help that much as they were firm also. We thought we were sleeping on a wooden plank. Lifted up the sheets and there was a mattress, two blankets then a thin “feather” topper. After that the bed sheet. The pillows are old, smelled and hard. We were a family of 5 and had a number of rooms. They were all the same. They really need new mattress to memory forms to fix this issue.  Maybe read the reviews about the beds from this point to see if still an issue or getting better. You are by a canal; however it is very dirty with plastic, garbage and dead fish floating.  Not ideal place to sit out and enjoy a view. Breakfast was simple. Just toast , orange marmalade and butter every day. They also had corn flakes and raisins you could add to it. They did put out fresh pineapple every day also.  No variety. Coffee was good. When we arrived late in the evening croak roaches were running outside of the hostel. But I think this is just the area.  Not the most appealing place. The pictures online do not look like the hostel or the rooms. Feel bad with our review as we really liked the front end lady.

For who fly at Suvarnabhumi, take BTS to PhyraThai(พญาไท) station exchange to Airport rail link, will bring you to Suvarnabhumi Airport around 1 hour. (Check service time again) or cross to other side of sukhumvit road and grab taxi if you had flight at BTS closing time service.

Bed One Block Hostel,"13.75248105,100.53123076",“Overall comfortable enough for a night's stay (but probably not longer)”,"Nice, clean hostel, located very near to BTS station.The lockers are spacious (but you need to bring your own lock).","It seems they have a strict check-in time (2pm) . So if you arrive early, be prepared to wait with your luggage. [Other hostels do also, but they are usually flexible- they will allow you to check-in earlier if the rooms are ready]. Best to avoid arriving before 2pm if possible.The upper bunks have no railings or headboard. A restless sleeper who rolls over quite a lot may fall (possibly head first) and sustain a severe injury. The beds are quite large, so this may appear unlikely, but it may be a good idea anyway to avoid the upper bunks if possible. The latches on the bathroom doors are a bit oddly placed, and required a bit of a struggle to remove. If you find this happening, its possibly because you did not close the door completely before latching. But maybe it would be simpler if these could be changed to something more conventional.   The front counter is not manned 24 hours (I think it is 9am to 9pm). However, on check-in, they collect a 100 Baht deposit for the access card which is refundable. I am not sure how this refund is made if you have to leave before 9am. Staff seemed very absorbed on their phones on arrival; its a bit strange they don't notice you entering the building.",2019-08-16T00:00:00,Thailand,7,Anonymous,8.8,"Leisure trip,Solo traveller,Bed in 10-Bed Mixed Dormitory Room,Stayed 1 night",1.0,1.0,1
